    <p>
      We are living through one of those hinge moments in history when a new tool does not simply improve life at the margins — it rearranges the margins entirely. Artificial intelligence is not just another technology layered on top of our existing systems. It is a force multiplier for imagination, productivity, and human potential. Used well, AI will be a great emancipator.
    </p>

    <p>
      That word — emancipator — is deliberate. For centuries, progress has been tied to freeing human beings from drudgery. The plow reduced back-breaking agricultural labor. The steam engine multiplied muscle. The computer accelerated calculation and communication. AI, however, does something different. It multiplies cognition. It extends thought. It collaborates with creativity.
    </p>

    <p>
      On this very site, I posted a surreal article and image about the United States electing a nose as president — voters literally “scenting” a message to Washington. The piece featured the nose appointing an ear to conduct hearings and a mouth to oversee the national food supply. It was whimsical, absurd, and unexpectedly effective. I created it with AI.
    </p>

    <p>
      But I did not simply press a button and walk away.
    </p>

    <p>
      I directed. I instructed. I shaped tone and theme. I refined. The result was not machine imagination replacing mine; it was machine amplification enhancing it. The spark was human. The acceleration was artificial. The outcome was collaborative.
    </p>

    <p>
      That experience was revelatory.
    </p>

    <p>
      Using tools like ChatGPT and Copilot, I found that ideas which might have remained half-formed in my mind could be rapidly prototyped, revised, and brought to life. AI did not replace my creativity — it expanded its bandwidth. It removed friction. It gave structure to whimsy. It made production accessible.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is why I believe AI will be a remarkable unleashing of creativity across society.
    </p>

    <p>
      For centuries, creative expression has often been limited by skill bottlenecks. A brilliant storyteller who could not draw struggled to produce visual art. A visionary entrepreneur without coding skills needed capital and a technical team. A thinker with insight but limited time might never translate ideas into essays, prototypes, or products.
    </p>

    <p>
      AI lowers those barriers.
    </p>

    <p>
      It opens doors for individuals who previously lacked the means, time, or technical mastery to execute their vision. It democratizes capability. A single person, equipped with imagination and intelligent tools, can now design, write, model, compose, and publish at a level once reserved for well-funded teams.
    </p>

    <p>
      That is emancipatory.
    </p>

    <p>
      But emancipation rarely arrives without disruption.
    </p>

    <p>
      AI is already transforming industries — from media to law to education to logistics. Tasks that once required hours can be completed in minutes. Entire job categories will evolve. Some will disappear. New ones will arise. The velocity of change can feel destabilizing, even threatening.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yet society has faced this before.
    </p>

    <p>
      When agriculture mechanized, farm labor declined dramatically. When industrial manufacturing automated, factory roles shifted or vanished. When the internet arrived, entire retail models collapsed while new digital ecosystems flourished. Obsolescence is uncomfortable — but it is also catalytic.
    </p>

    <p>
      We should not fear obsolescence as an enemy. It is often the precondition for growth.
    </p>

    <p>
      When repetitive tasks become automated, human energy can move upward — toward strategy, creativity, care, innovation, and relationship. Efficiency creates surplus. Surplus creates options. Options create freedom.
    </p>

    <p>
      If AI dramatically increases productivity, then society as a whole becomes wealthier — at least in potential. We can produce more with less human time. That is extraordinary.
    </p>

    <p>
      But here is the central challenge:
    </p>

    <p>
      If AI amplifies productivity and concentrates returns in the hands of those who own the systems, then we risk widening inequality at precisely the moment when abundance becomes technically possible. Emancipation for some could become displacement for many.
    </p>

    <p>
      The technological shift therefore demands a parallel civic shift.
    </p>

    <p>
      If machines increasingly perform cognitive labor, then compensation structures tied exclusively to traditional employment may no longer distribute prosperity effectively. Our economic architecture was built for a labor-centric era. AI pushes us toward a capital-intensive, automation-enhanced era.
    </p>

    <p>
      That mismatch must be addressed.
    </p>

    <p>
      I believe that the disruption AI brings makes taxation reform not merely desirable but necessary. A society that benefits from automated productivity should design mechanisms that allow citizens to share in that productivity.
    </p>

    <p>
      One path forward is the adoption of a guaranteed monthly income supplement — not as charity, but as a dividend of collective technological advancement. If AI systems, trained on human knowledge and deployed within public infrastructure, generate immense economic value, then citizens should receive a baseline share of that value.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my view, that supplement should be <em>relational</em> and compatible with a flat-tax structure: the goal is not to punish capital accumulation, but to ensure society broadly shares in the gains that capital (and automation) can produce. If productivity and returns scale up, the dividend should scale up too—so the system rewards value creation while still distributing its benefits.
    </p>

    <p>
      A practical benefit of a relational, flat-tax-aligned approach is efficiency: a one-line monthly tax return combined with a guaranteed monthly income supplement could dramatically simplify government administration and remove the hours, days, and weeks individuals lose each year to needlessly complicated tax filings—freeing time for real work and creating large productivity gains.
    </p>

    <p>
      Such a supplement would provide stability amid transition. It would cushion displacement. More importantly, it would empower individuals to pursue education, entrepreneurship, caregiving, and creative work without existential fear.
    </p>

    <p>
      Alongside this, a relational taxation structure could ensure that taxation reflects not only income, but systemic impact. As AI scales productivity and concentrates gains, taxation mechanisms must scale accordingly to preserve social balance and shared opportunity.
    </p>

    <p>
      The goal is not to suppress innovation. On the contrary, it is to protect it.
    </p>

    <p>
      A society paralyzed by insecurity will resist technological advancement. A society that shares its gains can embrace it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Imagine a future in which AI handles much of the repetitive analytical work that once consumed our days. Citizens receive a guaranteed income supplement that ensures baseline security. Education is continuous and accessible. Creative production flourishes because time is liberated. Entrepreneurship expands because risk is survivable.
    </p>

    <p>
      In such a society, obsolescence is not a personal catastrophe; it is an evolutionary signal.
    </p>

    <p>
      AI’s immense change is undeniable. It will disrupt institutions. It will challenge assumptions about work and value. It will require thoughtful governance. But it also offers something rare in human history: the possibility of decoupling survival from drudgery.
    </p>

    <p>
      The nose-as-president satire on this site may be playful, but it illustrates something profound. With AI, imagination can leap further and faster than ever before. The barrier between idea and execution is collapsing. The human mind, supported by intelligent systems, becomes a studio, a laboratory, and a publishing house at once.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are not witnessing the replacement of humanity.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are witnessing its amplification.
    </p>

    <p>
      The question before us is not whether AI will change society — it already is. The question is whether we will redesign our economic and civic structures to match the abundance it makes possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we do, AI will not merely be a disruptive force.
    </p>

    <p>
      It will be a liberating one.
    </p>
